# AutoPWNs

This is a repo where I stored the AutoPWN scripts that I have made for vulnerable machines from different platforms.

# Languages

The three most used languages that I used for AutoPWNs are:

- Bash
- Python
- C#

# Activity

I'm not very active in CTF platforms. I spent most of my free time building my own vulnerable machines and creating CTF challenges instead.

# Updates

This repo is updated maybe once every 5 months. This might change in the future though.
